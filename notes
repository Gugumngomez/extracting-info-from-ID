1) A Python file has the extension .py so it can be ran using python ID.py 

2) use the main to call your function in the desired logic...

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            call_functions()

3) Work in branches 

4) Fix the logic on your code.
    a) it runs only once
    b) after taking in the ID number it does nothing
